Few examples of the projects I created during the HyperionDev bootcamp

The email.py file showcases my use of OOP to create a working email inbox system.
Simply run the program in a IDE of your choice.

The inventory.py file accomodated with inventory.txt file uses OOP to create instances of products based on details written in the external file and allows the user to manage the inventory.
Simply run the program in a IDE of your choice.

The task_manager.py accomodated with tasks.txt and user.txt files is sophisticated program that is used to assign and manage tasks to its users.
Tasks and users are in the respective txt files and can be edited with the python program.
Simply run the program in a IDE of your choice. When prompted to enter username and password, enter 'admin' and 'adm1n' to see all options the program offers.
